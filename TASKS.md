## Guidelines

- All agents must query super-memory at start and save at end
- Sequential thinking is mandatory for complex tasks
- boomerang-init must only append to default personas, never replace core prompts
- Context compaction triggers at ~40% context usage
- Handoff skill should be called before compaction to preserve state
