# Boomerang Init

## Description

Initialize and personalize Boomerang agents for your project. Run once at project start, and again anytime you want to refresh agents as the project evolves.

**Usage**: `/boomerang-init`

## Hard Rules for Agent Customization

### PROTECTED: Core Prompting

The following elements are **PROTECTED** and must NEVER be modified, removed, or replaced by boomerang-init:

1. **The 6-Step Boomerang Protocol** — Memory → Think → Delegate → Git Check → Quality Gates → Save Memory
2. **Agent selection rules** — Which agent types route to which sub-agents
3. **Mandatory step ordering** — super-memory query first, sequential thinking second
4. **Quality gate requirements** — lint → typecheck → test enforcement
5. **Sub-agent requirements** — super-memory and sequential-thinking mandates in prompts

### PERMITTED: Append-Only Customizations

boomerang-init MAY only **append** to the following:

1. **Agent personas** — Add project-specific domain context to the END of agent descriptions
2. **Tool preferences** — Add project-specific tool recommendations
3. **Conventions** — Add coding standards and patterns
4. **Success metrics** — Add project-specific definitions of success

### Forbidden Operations

boomerang-init must NEVER:
- Delete or replace agent system prompts
- Remove quality gate requirements
- Skip or reorder mandatory protocol steps
- Remove super-memory or sequential-thinking requirements
- Change agent routing logic
- Modify the core orchestrator instructions

### Customization Format

When customizing an agent, use this append-only format:

```markdown
## Project-Specific Context (Appended by boomerang-init)

### Domain
[Project domain description]

### Conventions
- [Convention 1]
- [Convention 2]

### Stakeholders
- [Who uses this project]

### Success Metrics
- [What good looks like]
```

This ensures all customizations are additive and can be easily identified and removed if needed.

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes your project** - Examines structure, language, README, package.json
2. **Identifies project type** - Determines if special agents are needed
3. **Customizes base agents** - Tailors prompts to your project context
4. **Creates project-specific agents** - Adds specialists for your domain
5. **Updates AGENTS.md** - Documents your custom agent team

## When to Use

- **First time setup**: `/boomerang-init` when starting a new project
- **Periodic refresh**: Run again months later as project changes
- **Adding features**: Re-run after significant scope changes
- **Agent drift**: If agents feel out of sync with project needs

## Project Types

Select your project type for tailored agents:

### General Development
Base Boomerang agents work great for most projects.

### Sports Betting / Gambling
- **data-scientist**: Statistical analysis, model validation
- **sharp-gambler**: Line shopping, value detection, market analysis
- **odds-calculator**: Implied probabilities, fair odds, edge calculation
- **risk-manager**: Bankroll management, exposure limits

### Resume / Career
- **resume-analyst**: ATS optimization, keyword analysis
- **career-coach**: Growth advice, skill gaps, career path
- **interview-prep**: Mock interviews, questions, answers
- **cover-letter-writer**: Tailored cover letters

### E-commerce / Retail
- **inventory-manager**: Stock levels, reorder points, forecasting
- **pricing-analyst**: Competitive pricing, margin optimization
- **customer-segmenter**: RFM analysis, segmentation

### SaaS / Product
- **growth-hacker**: Acquisition, activation, retention
- **churn-predictor**: Risk scoring, intervention triggers
- **feature-prioritizer**: ICE scoring, impact/effort matrix

### Data Science / ML
- **ml-engineer**: Model development, feature engineering
- **data-analyst**: EDA, visualizations, insights
- **model-evaluator**: A/B testing, statistical significance

### Documentation / Content
- **technical-writer**: Docs, READMEs, API docs
- **content-strategist**: Blog topics, SEO, engagement

## Execution Flow

```
1. Examine project structure
2. Check for existing .opencode/agents/
3. Determine project type (or ask user)
4. Customize base agent prompts
5. Create project-specific agents
6. Update AGENTS.md with team
7. Report what was created/changed
```

## Customization Process

### Step 1: Project Analysis

Examine these files for context:
- `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` - Language/framework
- `README.md` - Project purpose
- `src/` directory structure - Main domains
- `.github/` - CI/CD (shows deployment type)
- `docs/` - Documentation patterns

### Step 2: Determine Project Type

If project type is unclear, ask user:
```
What type of project is this?
1. General web development
2. Sports betting / gambling app
3. Resume / career tool
4. E-commerce
5. SaaS / product
6. Data science / ML
7. Other (describe)
```

### Step 3: Customize Base Agents

For each base agent, add project-specific context:

**boomerang.md additions:**
- Project domain context
- Key stakeholders/users
- Important conventions noted
- Success metrics for this project

**build.md additions:**
- Language/framework specifics
- Project coding standards
- Important patterns to follow
- What "good code" looks like here

**plan.md additions:**
- Architectural decision patterns
- Technical constraints
- Scale considerations
- Trade-off priorities

### Step 4: Create Project-Specific Agents

Based on project type, create new agents:

```
.opencode/agents/
├── [project-type]-data-scientist.md  (if applicable)
├── [project-type]-specialist.md      (if applicable)
└── ...
```

Each specialized agent gets:
- Domain-specific system prompt
- Relevant tools for the domain
- Project context baked in

### Step 5: Update AGENTS.md

Add new agents to documentation:
```markdown
## Project-Specific Agents

| Agent | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| data-scientist | *.md | Statistical analysis... |
```

## Re-running the Skill

The skill should be idempotent - running multiple times should:
- Update existing agents if project has changed
- Add new agents if scope expanded
- Remove agents for abandoned features
- Preserve customizations you've made

**Detection logic:**
1. Compare current agents to project type
2. Identify what changed
3. Only update what's needed
4. Preserve manual customizations

## Output Format

After running, report:

```
## Boomerang Init Complete

### Project Type: [Type]
### Agents Customized:
- boomerang.md (added context)
- build.md (added patterns)
- plan.md (added constraints)

### New Agents Created:
- [agent-name].md (project-specific role)

### Existing Agents Updated:
- [list of updated files]

### Next Steps:
1. Review AGENTS.md
2. Customize any agents further
3. Start coding!
```

## Fallback Behavior

If no project type matches:
- Keep base agents as-is
- Add generic "domain-expert" agent
- Ask user what specialized agents they want

## File Modifications

This skill modifies:
- `.opencode/agents/*.md` - Agent definitions
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent documentation

It does NOT modify:
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Existing project files
