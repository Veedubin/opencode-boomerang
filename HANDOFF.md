# Boomerang Handoff

## Session History

### 2026-04-22 — v0.5.0 Massive Update Session

**Status**: v0.5.0 tagged, ready to push to GitHub and publish to NPM

#### What Was Accomplished

1. **Read all OpenCode documentation** (13 docs pages) and cached in super-memory for agent context
2. **Fixed super-memory protocol** — Made it MANDATORY for all 11 sub-agents (was optional before). Updated all agent prompts to enforce query-first, sequential-thinking, and save-at-end
3. **Model upgrade** — Updated all agents from Kimi K2.5 to K2.6 (orchestrator, architect, writer, init, handoff)
4. **Boomerang restrictions** — Limited to markdown-only file reading, restricted bash to git commands only for safety
5. **Architect-first planning** — Added mandatory architect review before build tasks in orchestrator workflow
6. **Missing agents** — Copied boomerang-writer, scraper, init, handoff skill definitions to `src/opencode_boomerang/assets/` so they're included in the Python package
7. **SKILL.md fixes** — Corrected wrong model names in documentation (K2.5 → K2.6)
8. **Super-memory-mcp updates**:
   - Added `boomerang_memory_search_tiered` and `boomerang_memory_search_parallel` tools
   - Added corruption detection and recovery for ChromaDB collections
   - Per-project DB isolation: removed hardcoded global DB path, each repo now gets its own `memory_data/`
9. **Fixed hanging issue**:
   - Added `steps:50` limit to prevent infinite loops
   - Error handling for memory failures
   - Anti-loop Task safety rules (no Task tools in sub-agents)
10. **Version bump** — pyproject.toml 0.3.0 → 0.5.0, package.json 0.4.0 → 0.5.0
11. **.gitignore** — Added `memory_data/` to prevent committing per-project memory databases

#### Key Decisions This Session

- **Super-memory is mandatory, not optional** — All agents must query before work and save after
- **Tiered memory architecture** — Fast Reply (MiniLM) for speed, Archivist (BGE+RRF) for maximum recall
- **Per-project DB isolation** — Each repo gets its own `memory_data/` directory instead of a global DB
- **Boomerang safety restrictions** — Markdown reads only, git-only bash to prevent accidental damage
- **Architect-first workflow** — Build tasks require architect review before coding begins
- **Model upgrade to K2.6** — Kimi K2.6 for reasoning agents, MiniMax M2.7 for fast execution agents

#### Files Modified

- All `.opencode/agents/*.md` files (11 agents)
- All `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` files (9 skills)
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated roster and mandatory protocol section
- `src/opencode_boomerang/assets/.opencode/agents/*.md` — Synced missing agents
- `docs/super-memory-mcp-update-spec.md` — Spec for memory updates
- Super-Memory server: `config.py`, `mcp_tools.py`, `memory.py`
- `pyproject.toml` — 0.3.0 → 0.5.0
- `.opencode/plugins/boomerang/package.json` — 0.4.0 → 0.5.0
- `.gitignore` — Added `memory_data/`

### 2026-04-21 — v0.3.0 Publishing & Framework Sync

**Status**: Published v0.3.0, GitHub Actions fixed, framework synced to 4 projects

#### What Was Accomplished
1. Published @veedubin/opencode-boomerang@0.3.0 to NPM
2. Fixed GitHub Actions workflows (removed PyPI, kept NPM-only)
3. Created 4 new agents: writer, scraper, init, handoff
4. Added comprehensive documentation (ROADMAP.md, docs/, examples/)
5. Updated orchestrator skill with mandatory session start protocol
6. Synced framework to 4 projects: sports-bet, proxy-hop, png2svg, resume-workspace
7. Removed misleading compactor skill
8. Added 29 integration tests for scraper (58 total tests passing)
9. Fixed .gitignore to properly track TypeScript source files

#### Key Decisions That Session
- NPM-only publishing (no PyPI)
- Plugin is the main deliverable, not Python wrapper
- Need granular NPM token with "Bypass 2FA" enabled for automation

## Resume Instructions

1. Read **HANDOFF.md** (this file) for session context
2. Read **AGENTS.md** for agent roster and protocol requirements
3. Read **TASKS.md** for current priorities
4. Query super-memory for detailed context about specific areas
5. Check git log for recent commits
6. If starting fresh, run `/boomerang-init` skill to initialize agents
